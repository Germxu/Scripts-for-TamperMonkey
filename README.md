## Afterwords:

The original intention of the development: Due to the real-time data processing needs of a third-party background page of a colleague, I studied the use of the oil monkey script. The effect is very satisfactory, the development is fast, and what you see is what you get. Although the Chrome extensions development is also very simple, but the oil monkey script is relatively simple It is easier to develop and release than without review, because there is no need to overturn the wall, and users are more convenient to download and use, so we will try our best to develop some script tools under the framework of Tampermonkey. However, Chrome extensions have more powerful permissions and functions, such as synchronous storage Independent interface, etc., later extension tools that require more powerful functions will be submitted to the Chrome store. After all, the $5 developer membership fee has been paid for several years ~~
